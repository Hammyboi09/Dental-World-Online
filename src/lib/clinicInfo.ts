Dental World is a trusted chain of modern and ethical dental clinics located in Punjabi Bagh, Rajouri Garden, Vasant Vihar, and Inderlok, New Delhi. Our team of skilled dentists and specialists is committed to providing advanced and hygienic dental care.

We proudly serve the community with a charitable clinic in Inderlok offering free or subsidized dental treatments, with special free dental camps held on May 8th, June 14th, June 29th, and November 2nd each year.

Our Vasant Vihar clinic has a rich legacy of 25 years, established by Dr. Balraj Sur after his retirement from government service. Another charitable clinic was set up in 1996 at Sainik Farms, where each team member has contributed at least one year of service.

In addition to dental care, our new venture, The Specialists Clinic, offers multi-specialty services, including gynecology, ENT, dermatology, pediatrics, orthopedics, dietetics, Botox, and hair care. Learn more at www.thespecialistsclinic.in.
